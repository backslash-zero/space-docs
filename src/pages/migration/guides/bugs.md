Users migrating may have encountered a few bugs while migrating. These bugs have been resolved for new migrations, but you may run into them when migrating resources, if you already encountered them.

## Bugs migrating Bases or Drives to Collections

Some users [migrating to Collections](/migration/guides/import-a-project) were met with the error: `A Collection with this name already exists. Please rename your Cloud Project.`

If you still meet this error when migrating Bases and Drives to Deta Collections, please contact us on [Discord](https://go.deta.dev/discord) or send us an email at `team@deta.space` with the subject line *I hit a bug migrating to Collections*.

## Bugs migrating Micros to Space

Some users following the [Micro Migration Guide](/migration/guides/migrate-a-micro) hit an error when trying to `deta clone` their Micro to their development machine.

If you follow the same guide and still encounter the same error, please contact us on [Discord](https://go.deta.dev/discord) or send us an email at `team@deta.space` with the subject line *I hit a bug migrating my Micro to Space*.
