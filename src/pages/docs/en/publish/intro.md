After pushing your app to Space, you’ll get your own personal copy: the Builder Instance. You may have built it for yourself and keep it that way. But you’re also just one step away from sharing your app with the whole world. This is done via **Publishing** an app to **Deta Discovery**. 

Deta Discovery is a global library of software that’s compatible with Space. It’s open to anyone to contribute to and use. Publishing an app to Discovery is powered by the personal cloud model, where others can install copies of apps on Discovery to their own Space.

When you publish an app to Discovery, you can share it with a limited audience, or make it massively available to people around the world. But you don’t have to think about any of the cloud resources needed to distribute and run your app. That’s the power of the personal cloud.

## Releases

To publish an app to Discovery, you need to create a **Release**. A **Release** is a copy others can use to install a personal copy of your app, in their Space. When they do so, they’ll be provisioned their own isolated resources to run the app. 

Deta Space offers two types of releases:

1. **Unlisted Releases**
2. **Listed Releases**

An Unlisted release is only accessible via a link Deta gives you when you release your app.  Anyone you share the link with will be able to install this Release, but this link is not publicly discoverable.

A **Listed** release is publicly discoverable from Deta Discovery’s homepage. Anyone who enters Discovery can find and install a listed application.

## Updates

A second core concept to publishing is **Updates**. If you add new features to your app after publishing it, you can publish a new Release. Every user who installed the app will get a notification to update it to the latest **Release**. Updates are opt-in by the user.

Currently, updates are only available for Listed Releases, but they are planned for Unlisted Releases.
