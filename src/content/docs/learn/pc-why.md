## Internet computing, designed for people

Since the internet was added to personal computers, they have transformed into gateways to the web. Web applications give people a lot of power to communicate, collaborate, and interact with the world. Many of these web applications are designed for people. But applications aren't a computer. And the "computing" that happens on the web is not designed for people. 

We believe there is a qualitatively better experience when you design the computer for people. The personal cloud is an attempt at this, in the age of the internet.

A personal cloud carries the intent of personal computers. Unlike traditional personal computers you know, a personal cloud lives in the web. So it's not just an autonomous and private home to [use](/docs/en/use) all your [apps](/docs/en/use/space-apps/intro) and [your data](/docs/en/use/your-data/collections). It's also a personal portal to and from the rest of the world. It's a place not only to author, but to share, receive, and engage. It's a launchpad for everything in it to interact with the rest of the world, human and machine. And it's a place to [discover](https://deta.space/discovery) and use incredible things that others are creating.

### For users

In the [traditional cloud model](/docs/en/learn/pc-what#public-cloud-application-model), the company who provides an application holds a lot of power. If the company decides it's not worth it to keep the app running and shuts down the infrastructure, happy users lose access. They also can't easily interact with, extend, or delete their own application data. Or add a custom domain, or more RAM to a sluggish service.

On the [personal cloud](/docs/en/learn/pc-what#personal-cloud-application-model), this all changes. Users can install and uninstall apps on a whim, with fine-grained control. They can inspect, modify, extend, and export all their data. Since everything is in one place, it can integrate directly. For users who are also developers, the control is extremely powerful: everything is raw material to build and explore with.

### For developers

Using the cloud providers of today, web developers with an idea need to do a lot to bring it to the world. They have to code their idea, but they also have to create, pay for, and operate the infrastructure to run it. This is a lot of work. For apps to serve users around the globe, this barrier usually requires teams of operational experts fighting [a large number of cloud tools](https://landscape.cncf.io/).

Using the personal cloud, things are entirely different. Individuals can [build](/docs/en/build) something for themselves, assuming they're the only user. They can stop there, if they want. Or they can [publish](/docs/en/publish) it to the world, and see it run everywhere. Anyone else with an internet connection can install the app, in another personal cloud. Throughout the entire process, the developer doesn't think about operating anything ✨ at all ✨.
