Every Space app you install as well as your Builder Instances come with a unique Built In Domain as well as support for Custom Domains.

The Built In Space domain is of the form `<subdomain>.deta.app`, while Custom Domains support most domains ([here is a list of unsupported TLDs](https://help.zerossl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060119833-Restricted-Countries)).
